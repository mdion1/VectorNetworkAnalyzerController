Set up measurement as you would with the front panel keys
-Select analyzer type ("Analyzer type" -> "Network Analyzer" or "NA")
-Select Active Channel ("Active channel" -> "Chan1" and/or "Chan2")
-Dual channel display ? ("Display" -> "Dual chan" -> "On")
-Set up trigger ("Trigger" -> "Manual")
-Set up sweep conditions ("Trigger" -> "Single"/"continuous")
	-"Sweep" -> "Sweep type menu" -> "Log freq"
-Select input port in NA mode ("Meas" -> "A/B")
-Select Meas. format ("Format" -> "PHASE" or "LIN MAG" or "LOG MAG", "PHASE UNIT DEG")
-Marker readout ? ("Utility" -> "smth/polar menu" -> "LIN MAG PHASE")

!! "NA"			network analyzer
!! "MEAS AB"		input port A/B
"FMT LINM"		format linear mag
"FMT PHASE"		format phase
"PHAU DEG"		phase unit degrees
"AUTO"			autoscale
"SCAL <numeric>"	scale/div
"ATTA <numeric>"	Atten A
"ATTB <numeric>"	Atten B
"ATTR <numeric>"	Atten ref
"AVER {ON|OFF}"		averaging on or off
"AVERFACT <numeric>"	averaging factor

"SWETAUTO {ON|OFF}"	sweep time auto/manual



source
!! "POWE <numeric>"	source power, in dBm
	0dBm = 100mW = 316.180mV amp = 223.607Vrms
	P(W) = V^2 / (50 Ohms)
	P(dBm) = 10 * log(P)
	may need to round to the nearest 0.1d	B

trigger
"TRGS MAN"		manual trigger


!! "STAR <numeric>HZ"	sets start val for sweep
!! "STOP <numeric>HZ"	sets stop val for sweep
!! "POIN <numeric>"	number of points (2 to 801)
!! "SWPT LOGF"		sweep time log freq
!! "SING"		executes a single trigger

"CIRF LIN"		smith/pol menu -> lin mag phase

"OUTPMKR?"		output marker value

!! "FORM3"		Data transferred as 64-bit floats
!! "FORM4"		Data transferred as ASCII chars

"OUTPDATA?"
!! "OUTPRAW{1-4}?"	Outputs the uncorrected data arrays for the active channel

"*STB?"	reads the status byte register
!! "ESB?" returns Instrument event status register contents
	Need to read bit 0 of "Event Status Register B(ESB)", which means SING, NUMG, or Cal std complete
